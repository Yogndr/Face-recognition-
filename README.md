Attendance Management System Using Face Recognition-

This project involves building an attendance system which utilizes facial recognition to mark the presence,current date and time.It covers areas such as facial detection, alignment, and recognition to cater to various use cases of the system such as viewing attendance reports. This project intends to serve as an efficient substitute for traditional manual attendance systems. It can be used in corporate offices, schools, and organizations where security is essential.

This project aims to automate the traditional attendance system where the attendance is marked manually. Its added features serve as an efficient upgrade and replacement over the traditional attendance system.

Scope of the project-

Facial recognition is becoming more prominent in our society. It has made major progress in the field of security. It is a very effective tool that can help low enforcers to recognize criminals and software companies are leveraging the technology to help users access the technology. This technology can be further developed to be used in other avenues such as ATMs, accessing confidential files, or other sensitive materials. This project servers as a foundation for future projects based on facial detection and recognition. Using this system any corporate offices, school and organization can replace their traditional way of maintaining attendance of the employees.
